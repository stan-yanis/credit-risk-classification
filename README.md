Credit Risk Analysis Report

The overall accuracy indicates that the model is highly effective for this dataset. Based on the metrics above, the logistic regression model is very effective at predicting both healthy and high-risk loans, with particularly strong performance in identifying healthy loans. The logistic regression model is performing exceptionally well in predicting healthy loans (0). Its performance is also very strong in identifying high-risk loans (1), albeit with slightly lower precision. The high recall for high-risk loans is particularly important in a credit risk context, as it means the model is effective at flagging most of the potential risky loans.

For 0 (Healthy Loan):

*Precision: 1.00 -This means that when the model predicts a loan as healthy, it is correct 100% of the time.

*Recall: 1.00 - This indicates that the model successfully identifies 100% of the actual healthy loans.

*F1-Score: 1.00 - The F1-score, which is a balance between precision and recall, is perfect for healthy loans, indicating excellent model performance for this class.
For 1 (High-Risk Loan):

*Precision: 0.87 - When the model predicts a loan as high-risk, it is correct 87% of the time.

*Recall: 0.95 - The model identifies 95% of all actual high-risk loans correctly.

*F1-Score: 0.91 - This is a strong F1-score, suggesting a good balance between precision and recall for high-risk loans.
